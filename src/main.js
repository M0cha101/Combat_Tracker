// I want the combat tracker to basically load up and welcome you to the tracker
// Then it will prompt you to enter all the combatants and I guess each person will
// just have a name/HP/Initiative(Maybe condition as well or speed, but name/HP/Init for sure)
// once you are done entering the name and HP that person will be placed onto the screen
// displaying their information, if a person has a higher initiative then they should
// go at the top, when you enter another character it should know where it goes within
// the other combatants, then it will allow you to start combat, so it should start at
// the first person, you should be able to change their hp and condition or whatever
// then when that turn is over it should highlight or have an arrow pointing towards the next
// person, once it reaches the last person, it should loop around to the first person again

// If a combatant dies, it should either remove them or just put some sort of indicator
// that they are dead, there should be a button that lets you end combat too
